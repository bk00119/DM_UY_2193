I think it's very important to start desigining wireframes after understanding the true problem that we're trying to solve and help users with our product or service. Also, I definitely think design process should be interactive, meaning the design should keep changing after user feedback. Then, while sketching the wireframes, the designer needs to think about how it would actually be programmed. Although the design can be cool and awesome, it should be pretty realistic.
